                <h2>Americano</h2>
                <img src="images/americano.png" alt="americano">
                <p>A single shot of espresso added to a cup of hot water. Many like to drink this as they would a regular brewed coffee with milk and sugar. Purists say to keep milk to a minimum to get the most flavor from the espresso.</p>

                <img src="images/caffeLatte.png" alt="caffe latte">
                <p>A cafe latte, or "latte" for short, is an espresso-based drink with steamed milk and micro-foam added to the coffee. This coffee is much sweeter compared to espresso due to the steamed milk.</p>

                <img src="images/cappuccino.png" alt="cappuccino">
                <p>A cappuccino is like a latte. However, the key difference between a latte and cappuccino is that a cappuccino has more foam and chocolate placed on top of the drink. Further, a cappuccino is made in a cup rather than a tumbler glass.</p>
